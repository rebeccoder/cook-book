## UX

### Visitor Goals

The main target audience for the website are as follows:

- Vegans
- People who are interested in the vegan diet

The main user goals are:

- Provide a space for users to share their vegan recipes
- Allow the user to create, display, update and delete the recipes that they share
- Ensure all the recipes are displayed on the homepage
- Ensure that the user can only edit and delete their own recipe not anyone elses
- Provide a search bar so that the user can search for any recipes by name
- Each recipe having it's own page with all the instructions in one place

### Design Choices

#### Colours

To keep within the expected theme of a usual vegan website the main stand out colour I used was a light green on the nav bar and an even lighter green for the forms. 
The image I used for the background has avocado flesh on it (vegans loooove avocado) and the light green I've used is similar to that which I thought really complimented the background.
I also added a splash of orange to brighten the page.
The headers for each page are in black so that they are easy to see.
The text within the forms is currently in grey although I may change this in down the line.

hex code colours are as follows:

### Fonts

After playing around with a few fonts I decided to go with Rajdhani from Google fonts.
Thicker fonts didn't suit the website very much, I liked Rajdhani font as it is minimal, tidy and clear. I also added a shadow to this font which subtly makes it pop out more.

### Styling

A lot of the styling came from the website Materialize such as the template cards, navbar and footer elements and was inspired by the Mini Project Tutorial by Code Institute.
